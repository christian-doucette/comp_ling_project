"this movie was bad from the start the only purpose of the movie was that angela wanted to get a high body count the acting was horrible the killings were acted out very badly like when ally got stuffed down that toilet i guess it was in the abandoned cabin but when the end of the movie comes and molly and the other guy are in the cabin you see ally so angela must have gone in to get her the part that really got me was when the black girl and angela were in the cabin and angela took the guitar string and chocked her one it was horrible acting and two why wouldnt you just turn around and punch the bitch then when molly is getting chased by angela if you have the neigh why not just turn around and stab her so stupid this movie sucked ","-1"
"i have to say i was really looking forward on watching this film and finding some new life in it that would separate it from most dull and overly crafted mexican films i have no idea why but i trusted sexo pudor y lagrimas to be the one to inject freshness and confidence to our non existent industry maybe it was because the soundtrack which i listened to before i saw the film sounded different from others maybe it was because it dared to include newer faces apart from demian bichir who is always a favorite of mexican film directors and supposedly dealed within its script with modern social behaviour maybe because its photography i saw in the trailers was bright and realistic instead of theatrical the film turned out to be a major crowd pleaser and a major letdown what serrano actually deals here with is the very old fashioned battle of the sexes as in all men are the same and why is it that all women blah blah blah nothing new in it not even that it uses so much common ground and clich that it eventually mocks itself without leaving any valuable reflexion on the female male condition full of usual tramps on the audience like safe gags about the clich s i talked about before those always work always and screaming performances it is a well acted film in its context and by screaming i mean literally the at first more compelling characters played by monica dionne and demian bichir turn out to be according to serrano the more pathetic ones i completely disagree with serrano they shouldnt have been treated that way only to serve as marionettes for his lesson to come through he made sure we got his message and completely destroyed their roles that were the only solid ground in which this story could have stood anyway it is after all a very entertaining film at times and you will probably have a good time seeing it if you accept to be manipulated by it ","-1"
"this film powerfully demonstrates the struggle of two women in love in a culture so deeply entrenched in ritual and tradition all this against a backdrop of an india which itself is struggling for freedom from these same values this film is both political and personal and never too preachy or idealistic on either front it is easy to see why fire has caused riots in india but tragic nonetheless a true film such as this one deserves to be seen by all people of the world not just privileged westerners ","1"
"the first 10 minutes of the movie makes fun of sequels and pg 13 movies these are the 2 reasons the movie is so bad they constantly reference a movie called get leo which is the movie in a movie version of get shorty every time they do this you will be really angry travolta isnt very cool neither is keitel however the rock and vince vaughn are hilarious they arent the kind of funny you would expect to see in an elmore leonard movie though if you havent seen get shorty you will probably like be cool if you liked get shorty you will leave the theater wanting to kill the director and screenwriter wait for the dvd ","-1"
"utterly brilliant powerful and evocative the most compelling documentary series ever made concerning war its tone offers a stark contrast to the often gung ho attitude towards world war 2 that the media exhibits rather than opting for screaming about the horror of war it allows sir laurence oliviers quiet voice to take a back seat to the true images of war corpses everywhere explosions terrified citizens and soldiers broken men indifferent politicians mistakes that cost thousands of lives the suffering of the innocents most of all it truly brings home that mankind is capable of when all normal rules of civility are removed there is something distinctly hobbesian about man in a true state of nature he will return to a more beastly form capable of crimes that will still shock and fascinate 60 years on perhaps there could be a follow up series called the century at war for the twentieth century was truly the century of horrors i feel it is an irony of immense magnitude that it took an event which caused the death of 50 million people to produce such a compelling and excellent series such as this ","1"
"when i saw this film in the 1950s i wanted to be a scientist too there was something magical and useful in science i took a girl friend along to see it a second time i dont think she was as impressed as i was this film was comical yet serious at a time when synthetic fibres were rather new lessons from this film could be applied to issues relating to gm experimentation of today ","1"
"i happened upon this movie as an 8 10 year old on a cold dark november afternoon i was outside playing all day freezing and when i came in around 4pm i had a cup of hot cocoa and sat down in front of the tv with a blanket i was surprised to be watching a cartoon that wasnt all happy and silly and was in fact dark and moralistic it captured my imagination im sure it misses the text and is abbreviated in all the wrong places for the tolkien purist but it still captures the spirit of the story the choice to carry a burden for the good of others the consequences of selfish rash decisions etc the quality of animation leaves room for complaint but the one place where this movie clearly rises above the new films is the voice characterizations john hurt is great in this if you dont like how the character is drawn look away and just listen to him his voice is extraordinary ive seen it again many many times and it always brings me back to that time as a kid thirsty for some magical adventure its for this reason i say lucky the film is nostalgic for me so i overlook its shortcomings but between john hurt and tolkiens fantasy it still reached me and still does ","1"
"my god buttgereits masterpiece is one of the best movies ive ever seen closer to peter greenaway and jean luc godards movies this one is really disturbing but not gruesome as the nekromantiks all the little stories have a deep philosophic interest and the directing is totally inventive in spite of the lack of money see the bridge sketch highly highly recommended ","1"

"although super mario 64 isnt like the rest of the games in the series it is still a classic and is every bit as good as the old games games with this much replay value are few and far between plus this game has so much variety there are 15 levels each with several different tasks you can do and many other hidden tasks the game isnt very challenging but its lack of challenge doesnt take away from the game at all once you beat it youll want to erase your game and start again and its just as much fun the second time or third time or two hundredth time a must own for any nintendo 64 owner and is a reason in itself to own a nintendo 64 ","1"

"one more of those brilliant young men who went all out and dared to make a teen romance film can i actually call it that it would invoke the devil out of its fans on a micro budget but packed with such taste sensitiveness and maturity peter sollett you deserve more admiration and respect thanks once again for demonstrating to the powers that be in the industry that stereotypes can be flushed down the toilet one location a handful of rich characters low budget good acting and that too amateurs decent lighting worshippers of true indie cinema should watch more of this and stop watching well you know what ","1"

"i foolishly read the back of the dvd cover of this movie in best buy about a year ago and said to myself seems funny plus it has michael clarke duncan how can i lose i proceeded to pay 15 99 plus tax for it i took it over to a friends house and we both stood aghast at how poorly it was written and acted wooden performances abound all the hilarious and outstanding performances promised never seemed to arrive after 90 minutes i hung my head in shame knowing that i could never get that 90 minutes or 15 99 back i literally almost cried as well because if that was what could be considered comedy i didnt want to believe in movies anymore my friend and i constantly informed a friend of ours of the horror of this movie to the point that he needed to see it just to understand how bad it was over the holiday season this year i watched it with him because he didnt want to watch it alone this was my next horrible mistake because as i watched i just became angry i began to yell at the movie and im not one to talk to movies period everyone i know that has even glimpsed this movie has agreed its the worst theyve ever seen my sense of humor is sick and twisted and often offends my friends but that could not save this movie even the fact that this movie is not on the bottom 100 list on imdb is astounding the fact that its rating at the time of this writing is 3 6 is a crime against humanity ","-1"

"a man arrives in a strange beautiful sterile city where no one feels any emotion and obsesses instead about interior design the essential sameness of his days is reminiscent of groundhog day the strange passages in and out of this world more remind one of being john malkovich but truly this is a scandanavian movie a piece of self satire that is also scandanavian in style the tone is austere and even the most fantastic scenes are played straight daring you to laugh at the absurdity to my mind the combination isnt wholly successful there arent enough genuine laughs to compensate for the difficulties of taking the piece as pure drama it certainly is original perhaps my problem is that the world that it satirises is not one that i recognise perhaps i should move to scandanavia ","1"

"the tortuous emotional impact is degrading whether adult or adolescent the personal values shown in this movie belong in a bad psychodrama if anywhere at all this movie has a plot but it is all evil from start to end this is no way for people to act and degrades both sexes all the way through the movie teen killing bad preteen sex bad emotional battering bad animal cruelty bad psychological torture bad parental neglect bad the only merit if any is the excellent color shots of contrasting red blond and green leaves a bad feeling for anyone that respects life and peace what a bad mistake to make or to watch it is ugly","-1"
