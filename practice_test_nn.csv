"one of the other reviewers has mentioned that after watching just 1 oz episode youll be hooked they are right as this is exactly what happened with me the first thing that struck me about oz was its brutality and unflinching scenes of violence which set in right from the word go trust me this is not a show for the faint hearted or timid this show pulls no punches with regards to drugs sex or violence its is hardcore in the classic use of the word it is called oz as that is the nickname given to the oswald maximum security state penitentary it focuses mainly on emerald city an experimental section of the prison where all the cells have glass fronts and face inwards so privacy is not high on the agenda em city is home to many aryans muslims gangstas latinos christians italians irish and more so scuffles death stares dodgy dealings and shady agreements are never far away i would say the main appeal of the show is due to the fact that it goes where other shows wouldnt dare forget pretty pictures painted for mainstream audiences forget charm forget romance oz doesnt mess around the first episode i ever saw struck me as so nasty it was surreal i couldnt say i was ready for it but as i watched more i developed a taste for oz and got accustomed to the high levels of graphic violence not just violence but injustice crooked guards wholl be sold out for a nickel inmates wholl kill on order and get away with it well mannered middle class inmates being turned into prison bitches due to their lack of street skills or prison experience watching oz you may become comfortable with what is uncomfortable viewing thats if you can get in touch with your darker side ","1"
"a wonderful little production the filming technique is very unassuming very old time bbc fashion and gives a comforting and sometimes discomforting sense of realism to the entire piece the actors are extremely well chosen michael sheen not only has got all the polari but he has all the voices down pat too you can truly see the seamless editing guided by the references to williams diary entries not only is it well worth the watching but it is a terrificly written and performed piece a masterful production about one of the great masters of comedy and his life the realism really comes home with the little things the fantasy of the guard which rather than use the traditional dream techniques remains solid then disappears it plays on our knowledge and our senses particularly with the scenes concerning orton and halliwell and the sets particularly of their flat with halliwells murals decorating every surface are terribly well done ","1"
"i thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light hearted comedy the plot is simplistic but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable even the well bread suspected serial killer while some may be disappointed when they realize this is not match point 2 risk addiction i thought it was proof that woody allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love this was the most id laughed at one of woodys comedies in years dare i say a decade while ive never been impressed with scarlet johanson in this she managed to tone down her sexy image and jumped right into a average but spirited young woman this may not be the crown jewel of his career but it was wittier than devil wears prada and more interesting than superman a great comedy to go see with friends ","1"
"basically theres a family where a little boy jake thinks theres a zombie in his closet his parents are fighting all the time this movie is slower than a soap opera and suddenly jake decides to become rambo and kill the zombie ok first of all when youre going to make a film you must decide if its a thriller or a drama as a drama the movie is watchable parents are divorcing arguing like in real life and then we have jake with his closet which totally ruins all the film i expected to see a boogeyman similar movie and instead i watched a drama with some meaningless thriller spots 3 out of 10 just for the well playing parents descent dialogs as for the shots with jake just ignore them ","-1"
"petter matteis love in the time of money is a visually stunning film to watch mr mattei offers us a vivid portrait about human relations this is a movie that seems to be telling us what money power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter this being a variation on the arthur schnitzlers play about the same theme the director transfers the action to the present time new york where all these different characters meet and connect each one is connected in one way or another to the next person but no one seems to know the previous point of contact stylishly the film has a sophisticated luxurious look we are taken to see how these people live and the world they live in their own habitat the only thing one gets out of all these souls in the picture is the different stages of loneliness each one inhabits a big city is not exactly the best place in which human relations find sincere fulfillment as one discerns is the case with most of the people we encounter the acting is good under mr matteis direction steve buscemi rosario dawson carol kane michael imperioli adrian grenier and the rest of the talented cast make these characters come alive we wish mr mattei good luck and await anxiously for his next work ","1"
"probably my all time favorite movie a story of selflessness sacrifice and dedication to a noble cause but its not preachy or boring it just never gets old despite my having seen it some 15 or more times in the last 25 years paul lukas performance brings tears to my eyes and bette davis in one of her very few truly sympathetic roles is a delight the kids are as grandma says more like dressed up midgets than children but that only makes them more fun to watch and the mothers slow awakening to whats happening in the world and under her own roof is believable and startling if i had a dozen thumbs theyd all be up for this movie ","1"
"i sure would like to see a resurrection of a up dated seahunt series with the tech they have today it would bring back the kid excitement in me i grew up on black and white tv and seahunt with gunsmoke were my heros every week you have my vote for a comeback of a new sea hunt we need a change of pace in tv and this would work for a world of under water adventure oh by the way thank you for an outlet like this to view many viewpoints about tv and the many movies so any ole way i believe ive got what i wanna say would be nice to read some more plus points about sea hunt if my rhymes would be 10 lines would you let me submit or leave me out to be in doubt and have me to quit if this is so then i must go so lets do it ","1"
"this show was an amazing fresh innovative idea in the 70s when it first aired the first 7 or 8 years were brilliant but things dropped off after that by 1990 the show was not really funny anymore and its continued its decline further to the complete waste of time it is today its truly disgraceful how far this show has fallen the writing is painfully bad the performances are almost as bad if not for the mildly entertaining respite of the guest hosts this show probably wouldnt still be on the air i find it so hard to believe that the same creator that hand selected the original cast also chose the band of hacks that followed how can one recognize such brilliance and then see fit to replace it with such mediocrity i felt i must give 2 stars out of respect for the original cast that made this show such a huge success as it is now the show is just awful i cant believe its still on the air ","-1"
"encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here i was looking forward to watching this film bad mistake ive seen 950 films and this is truly one of the worst of them its awful in almost every way editing pacing storyline acting soundtrack the films only song a lame country tune is played no less than four times the film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme rarely have i been so happy to see the end credits of a film the only thing that prevents me giving this a 1 score is harvey keitel while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort one for keitel obsessives only ","-1"

"phil the alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines at first it was very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progressed i didnt find the jokes or oddness funny anymore its a low budget film thats never a problem in itself there were some pretty interesting characters but eventually i just lost interest i imagine this film would appeal to a stoner who is currently partaking for something similar but better try brother from another planet","-1"
"i saw this movie when i was about 12 when it came out i recall the scariest scene was the big bird eating men dangling helplessly from parachutes right out of the air the horror the horror as a young kid going to these cheesy b films on saturday afternoons i still was tired of the formula for these monster type movies that usually included the hero a beautiful woman who might be the daughter of a professor and a happy resolution when the monster died in the end i didnt care much for the romantic angle as a 12 year old and the predictable plots i love them now for the unintentional humor but about a year or so later i saw psycho when it came out and i loved that the star janet leigh was bumped off early in the film i sat up and took notice at that point since screenwriters are making up the story make it up to be as scary as possible and not from a well worn formula there are no rules ","-1"
"so im not a big fan of bolls work but then again not many are i enjoyed his movie postal maybe im the only one boll apparently bought the rights to use far cry long ago even before the game itself was even finsished people who have enjoyed killing mercs and infiltrating secret research labs located on a tropical island should be warned that this is not far cry this is something mr boll have schemed together along with his legion of schmucks feeling loneley on the set mr boll invites three of his countrymen to play with these players go by the names of til schweiger udo kier and ralf moeller three names that actually have made them selfs pretty big in the movie biz so the tale goes like this jack carver played by til schweiger yes carver is german all hail the bratwurst eating dudes however i find that tils acting in this movie is pretty badass people have complained about how hes not really staying true to the whole carver agenda but we only saw carver in a first person perspective so we dont really know what he looked like when he was kicking a however the storyline in this film is beyond demented we see the evil mad scientist dr krieger played by udo kier making genetically mutated soldiers or gms as they are called performing his top secret research on an island that reminds me of spoiler vancouver for some reason thats right no palm trees here instead we got some nice rich lumberjack woods we havent even gone far before i started to cry mehehe i cannot go on any more if you wanna stay true to bolls shenanigans then go and see this movie you will not be disappointed it delivers the true boll experience meaning most of it will suck there are some things worth mentioning that would imply that boll did a good work on some areas of the film such as some nice boat and fighting scenes until the whole cromed albino gms squad enters the scene and everything just makes me laugh the movie far cry reeks of scheisse thats poop for you simpletons from a fa r if you wanna take a wiff go ahead btw carver gets a very annoying sidekick who makes you wanna shoot him the first three minutes hes on screen ","-1"
"the cast played shakespeare shakespeare lost i appreciate that this is trying to bring shakespeare to the masses but why ruin something so good is it because the scottish play is my favorite shakespeare i do not know what i do know is that a certain rev bowdler hence bowdlerization tried to do something similar in the victorian era in other words you cannot improve perfection i have no more to write but as i have to write at least ten lines of text and english composition was never my forte i will just have to keep going and say that this movie as the saying goes just does not cut it ","-1"

"kind of drawn in by the erotic scenes only to realize this was one of the most amateurish and unbelievable bits of film ive ever seen sort of like a high school film project what was rosanna arquette thinking and what was with all those stock characters in that bizarre supposed midwest town pretty hard to get involved with this one no lessons to be learned from it no brilliant insights just stilted and quite ridiculous but lots of skin if that intrigues you videotaped nonsense what was with the bisexual relationship out of nowhere after all the heterosexual encounters and what was with that absurd dance with everybody playing their stereotyped roles give this one a pass its like a million other miles of bad wasted film money that could have been spent on starving children or aids in africa ","-1"
"some films just simply should not be remade this is one of them in and of itself it is not a bad film but it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title liam neeson was excellent as he always is and most of the cast holds up with the exception of owen wilson who just did not bring the right feel to the character of luke but the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the shirley jackson story in its attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects again i will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film but you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more ","1"
"this movie made it into one of my top 10 most awful movies horrible there wasnt a continuous minute where there wasnt a fight with one monster or another there was no chance for any character development they were too busy running from one sword fight to another i had no emotional attachment except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies lotr star wars and matrix examples the ghost scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old star wars with yoda obee one and vader the spider machine in the beginning was exactly like frodo being attacked by the spider in return of the kings elijah wood is the victim in both films and wait it hypnotizes stings its victim and wraps them up uh hello and the whole machine vs humans theme was the matrix or terminator there are more examples but why waste the time and will someone tell me what was with the nazis nazis there was a juvenile story line rushed to a juvenile conclusion the movie could not decide if it was a childrens movie or an adult movie and wasnt much of either just awful a real disappointment to say the least save your money ","-1"
"i remember this film it was the first film i had watched at the cinema the picture was dark in places i was very nervous it was back in 74 75 my dad took me my brother sister to newbury cinema in newbury berkshire england i recall the tigers and the lots of snow in the film also the appearance of grizzly adams actor dan haggery i think one of the tigers gets shot and dies if anyone knows where to find this on dvd etc please let me know the cinema now has been turned in a fitness club which is a very big shame as the nearest cinema now is 20 miles away would love to hear from others who have seen this film or any other like it ","1"
"an awful film it must have been up against some real stinkers to be nominated for the golden globe theyve taken the story of the first famous female renaissance painter and mangled it beyond recognition my complaint is not that theyve taken liberties with the facts if the story were good that would perfectly fine but its simply bizarre by all accounts the true story of this artist would have made for a far better film so why did they come up with this dishwater dull script i suppose there werent enough naked people in the factual version its hurriedly capped off in the end with a summary of the artists life we could have saved ourselves a couple of hours if theyd favored the rest of the film with same brevity ","-1"
